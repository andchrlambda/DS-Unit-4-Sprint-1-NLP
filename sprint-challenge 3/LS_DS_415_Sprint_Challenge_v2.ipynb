    "After a week of Natural Language Processing, you've learned some cool new stuff: how to process text, how turn text into vectors, and how to model topics from documents. Apply your newly acquired skills to one of the most famous NLP datasets out there: [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge). As part of the job selection process, some of my friends have been asked to create analysis of this dataset, so I want to empower you to have a head start.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The real dataset is massive (almost 8 gigs uncompressed). I've sampled the data for you to something more managable for the Sprint Challenge. You can analyze the full dataset as a stretch goal or after the sprint challenge. As you work on the challenge, I suggest adding notes about your findings and things you want to analyze in the future.\n",

    "**Overall Positive Reviews\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A preliminary analysis shows that these Yelp reviews are mostly positive, with 45% five-star ratings and 22%  4-star ratings. About one-third of of the reviews received 3 stars or less. The top 30 terms used in reviews indicate that scores are predominantly determined by quality, wait time, and service. These reviews appear to be mostly about restaurants, though some more fine-grained analyses reveal that, at a minimum, hotels and tour services are also included. In general, it appears that people post on Yelp when they have a positive experience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A recommendation for further analysis is to refine the search by combining some of the top 30 terms that have similar meanings, such as \"good\" and \"great\". We would also categorize reviews so that restaurants, tours, and other services are distinguished from one another. Within categorized services, we would  determine avarage star ratings in each domain, and elminate the most common words to reveal more specific descriptors relevant in each category. For example, \"food\" and \"chicken\" are currently in the top 30 terms, but if the reviews were categorized by domain, we could limit food-related terms to restauarnt reviews, and identify other domain-specific terms in other categories. \n"
